A survey is a data collection method that is administered to a sample. The sample is fraction of the target
population. The sample must be representative of the population and random sampling is used to ensure
an equal chance of being selected. A census is a special survey that collects data from the entire
population. Sampling error and bias cause problems in analysis made from survey data.

Students will view a video clip from the game show *Family Feud* to begin to think about survey
components. The video can be found at:

<ins>*Statistical/Mathematical:*</ins>

S-IC B-4: Use data from a sample survey to estimate a population mean or proportion; develop a margin of error through the use of simulation models for random sampling.

S-IC 1: Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on a random sample from that population.

S-IC 3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and
observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.

S-IC 6: Evaluate reports based on data.

<ins>*Data Science:*</ins>

Understand that bias and sampling error should be minimized when conducting surveys. The wording of
questions, as well as who is asked to participate in a survey, can lead to bias. Learn that sampling error
can be minimized when larger random samples are collected from a population.

<ins>*Applied Computational Thinking Using RStudio:*</ins>

• Create random samples of different sizes to make estimates about a population.

• Create informal confidence intervals based on sample medians.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>
1. Students will describe the attributes of a survey.

2. Students will engage in partner and whole group discussions to express their understanding of sampling techniques.

3. Students will connect informal confidence intervals to formal confidence intervals in RStudio/Posit Cloud.

<ins>*Data File:*</ins>

1. American Time-Use Survey (ATUS): ```data(atus)```
