##***<u>Lab 3B - Confound it all!</u>***

Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in <span style="color:midnightblue;">**blue**</span> on your computer, and answering the questions in <span style="color:firebrick;">**red**</span> in your journal.

###**Finding data in new places**
* Since your first forays into doing data science, you've used data from two sources:

    – Built-in datasets from RStudio.

    – Campaign data from the Campaign Manager.
    
* Data can be found in many other places though, especially online.

* In this lab, we'll read an *observational study* dataset from a website.

    – We'll use this data to then explore what factors are associated with a person's lung
    capacity.

###**Importing our data**
* Rather than *export*-ing the data and then *upload*-ing and *importing*-ing it, we'll pull the data
straight from the webpage into R.

* You can find the data online here:

    – (Right-click and select *Open in New Window*)<br> 
    [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkDataEd/dataset/main/fev.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkDataEd/dataset/main/fev.csv "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkDataEd/dataset/main/fev.csv"){:target="_blank"}

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Click on the *Import Dataset* button under the *Environment* tab.**</span>

    – Then click on the *From Text (readr)* option.

    – Type or copy/paste the URL into the box.
    
    – Click *Update*.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Before importing, change the following *Import Options*:**</span>

    – Name: ```lungs```

    – *Uncheck* the *First Row as Names*

    – *Change Delimiter* to *Whitespace*

###**Our new data**
* Variables that were measured include:

    – Age in years.

    – Lung capacity, measured in liters.

    – The youth's heights, in inches

    – Genders; ```"1"``` for males, ```"0"``` for females.

    – Whether the participant was a smoker, ```"1"```, or non-smoker ```"0"```.

###**About the data**
* The data come from the *Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV)* study that took place in the late
1970's.

* The observations come from a sample of 654 youths, aged 3 to 19, in/around East
    Boston.

* Researchers were interested in answering the *research question*:

    *What is the effect of childhood smoking on lung health?*

###**Cleaning your data**
* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Now that we've got the data loaded, we need to clean it to get it ready for use (*Look at [lab
1F](../unit1/lab1f.md) for help*). Specifically:**</span>

    – We want to name the variables: ```"age"```, ```"lung_cap"```, ```"height"```,
    ```"gender"```,```"smoker"```, in that order.

    – Change the type of variable for ```gender``` and ```smoker``` from *numeric* to *character*.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**After changing the variable types for ```gender``` and ```smoker```:**</span>

    – For ```gender```, use ```recode``` to change ```"1"``` to ```"Male"``` and ```"0"``` to ```"Female"```.

    – For ```smoker```, use ```recode``` to change ```"1"``` to ```"Yes"``` and ```"0"``` to ```"No"```.

###**Analyzing our data**
* Our ```lungs``` data is from an observational study.

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**Write down a reason the researchers couldn't use an experiment to test the effects of
smoking on children's lungs.**</span>

* Observational studies are often helpful for analyzing how variables are related:

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Do you think that a person's age affects their lung capacity? Make a sketch of what you think a scatterplot of the two variables would look like and explain.**</span>

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Use the ```lungs``` data to create an ```xyplot``` of ```age``` and ```lung_cap```.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Interpret the plot and describe why the relationship between the two variables
    makes sense.**</span>

###**Smoking and lung capacity**
* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Make a plot that can be used to answer the statistical investigative question:**</span>

    *Do people who smoke tend to have lower lung capacity than those who do not smoke?*

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**Use your plot to answer the question.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Were you surprised by the answer? Why?**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Can you suggest a possible confounding factor that might be affecting the result?**</span>

###**Let's compare**
* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Create three subsets of the data:**</span>

    – One that includes *only* 13-year-olds ...

    – One that includes *only* 15-year-olds ...

    – and one that includes *only* 17-year-olds.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Make a plot that compares the lung capacity of smokers and non-smokers for each subset.**</span>

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**How does the relationship between smoking and lung capacity change as we
increase the age from 13 to 15 to 17?**</span>

###**Sum it up!**
* <span style="color:firebrick;">**Does smoking affect lung capacity? If so, how?**</span>

    – Support your answers with appropriate plots.

    – Explain why you included the variables you used in your plots.
