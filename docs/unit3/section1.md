An experiment is a data collection method in which the effects of different treatments on an outcome of
interest are measured. In an experiment, a treatment is applied to subjects and then observations about
the effect of the treatment are made. To isolate the effects from unexplained variation, randomization (or
chance) assignment to treatments is applied.

Students will view Hans Rosling’s video *How Not to Be Ignorant About the World* and will participate in his
interactive quiz in order to learn how anecdotes and personal experience can influence what we know
and, alternatively, how data provides basis for evidence. The video can be found at:

<ins>*Statistical/Mathematical:*</ins>

S-IC B-5: Use data from a randomized experiment to compare two treatments; use simulations to decide if differences between parameters are significant.

S-IC 1: Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on
a random sample from that population.

S-IC 3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and
observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.

S-IC 6: Evaluate reports based on data.

S-IC B.5 Use data from a randomized experiment to compare two treatments; use simulations to decide if differences between parameters are significant.

<ins>*Focus Standards for Mathematical Practice for All of Unit 3:*</ins>

SMP-1: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

SMP-4: Model with mathematics.

SMP-8: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

<ins>*Data Science:*</ins>

Understand that differences between the measured outcomes of the treatment and control groups in an
experiment can be tested. Understand the roles of randomization and of random sampling in statistical
inference.

<ins>*Applied Computational Thinking:*</ins>

• Test for differences between experimental groups.

• Create graphical representations to compare data between experimental groups.

• Write code to randomly assign subjects to treatment groups

<ins>*Real-World Connections:*</ins>

Experiments are used to ensure safety and efficacy of medicines, reliability of electronics and structural
materials and find patterns in human behavior.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Language Objectives**</p>
1. Students will compare and contrast anecdotes with data.

2. Students will construct summary statements about their understanding of data, how it is collected, how it is used, and how to work with it when creating and conducting experiments.

3. Students will read informative texts to evaluate claims based on data and anticipate visualizations of that data.

4. Students will describe causal relationships.

##<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Data File or Data Collection Method**</p>

<ins>*Data File:*</ins>

1. Students’ *Time Perception* experiment data.

<ins>*Data Collection Method:*</ins>

Students will gather data generated through a simple experiment.
