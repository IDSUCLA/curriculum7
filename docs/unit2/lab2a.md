##**<u>Lab 2A - All About Distributions</u>**

Directions: Follow along with the slides, completing the questions in <span style="color:midnightblue;">**blue**</span> on your computer, and answering the questions in <span style="color:firebrick;">**red**</span> in your journal.

###**In the beginning...**
* Most of the labs thus far have covered how to visualize, summarize, and manipulate data.

    – We used visualizations to explore how your class spends their time.

    – We also learned how to clean data to prepare it for analyzing.

* Starting with this lab, we'll learn to use ```R``` to answer statistical investigative questions that can be
answered by calculating the mean, median and MAD.

###**How to talk about data**
* When we make plots of our data, we usually want to know:

* Where is the *bulk* of the data?

* Where is the data more *sparse*, or *thin*?

* What values are *typical*?

* How much does the data *vary*?

* To answer these questions, we want to look at the *distribution* of our data.

    – We describe *distributions* by talking about where the *center* of the data are, how
    *spread* out the data are, and what sort of *shape* the data has.

###**Let's begin!**
* *Export*, *upload* and *import* your class's *Personality Color* data.

    – Name your data ```colors``` when you load it.

* Before analyzing a new dataset, it's often helpful to get familiar with it. So:

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Write down the ```names``` of the 4 variables that contain the point-totals, or
    *scores*, for each personality color.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Write down the ```names``` of the variables that tell us an observation's introvert/extrovert designation and whether they are involved in *sports*.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**How many variables are in the dataset?**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**How many observations are in the dataset?**</span>

###**Estimating centers**
* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Create a ```dotPlot``` of the scores for your *predominant color*.**</span>

    – Pro-tip: If the ```dotPlot``` comes out looking wonky, include the ```nint``` and ```cex``` options. 

* Based on your ```dotPlot```:

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Which values came up the most frequently? About how many people in your
    class had a score similar to yours?**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**What, would you say, was a *typical* score for a person in your class for your
    predominant color? How does your own score for this color compare?**</span>

###**Means and medians**

* *Means* and *medians* are usually good ways to describe the *typical* value of our data.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Fill in the blank to calculate the ```mean``` value of your predominant color score:**</span>

        mean(~____, data = colors)

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Use a similar line of code to calculate the ```median``` value of *your* predominant color.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Are the ```mean``` and ```median``` roughly the same? If not, use the ```dotPlot``` you made
    in the last slide to describe why.**</span>

###**Estimating Spread**

* Now that we know how to describe our data's *typical* value we might also like to describe
how closely the rest of the data are to this *typical* value.

    – We often refer to this as the **variability** of the data.

    – Variability is seen in a ```histogram``` or ```dotPlot``` as the horizontal *spread*.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Re-create a ```dotPlot``` of the scores for your *predominant* color and then run the code below filling in the blank with the name of your predominant color:**</span>    

        add_line(vline = mean(~____, data = colors))

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**Look at the spread of the scores from the mean score then complete the sentence below:**</span>

    *Data points in my plot will usually fall within <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> units of the center.*

###**Mean Absolute Deviation**
* The **mean absolute deviation** finds how far away, on average, the data are from the mean.

    – We often write *mean absolute deviation* as *MAD.*

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Calculate the MAD of your *predominant color* by filling in the blanks:**</span>

        MAD(~_____, data = colors)

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**How close was your estimate of the spread for your predominant color (from the previous slide) to the actual value?**</span>

###**Comparing introverts/extroverts**
* Do introverts and extroverts differ in their typical scores for your predominant color?

    – Answer this investigative question using a dotPlot and numerical summaries.

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Make a ```dotPlot``` of your predominant color again; but this time, facet the plot by the introvert/extrovert variable. Include the ```layout``` option to stack the plots as well as the ```nint``` and ```cex``` options.**</span>

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**Describe the shape of the distribution of scores for the extroverts. Do the same for the introverts.**</span>

* <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Using similar syntax to how you facet plots, calculate either the ```mean``` or ```median``` to describe the *center* of your predominant color for introverts and extroverts.**</span>

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**Do introverts and extroverts differ in their typical scores for your predominant color?**</span>

* <span style="color:firebrick;">**Based on the MAD, which group (introverts or extroverts) has more variability for your predominant color’s scores?**</span>

###**On your own**

* Do introverts and extroverts in your class differ in their color scores?

    – <span style="color:midnightblue;">**Perform an analysis that produces *numerical summaries* and *graphs*.**</span>

    – <span style="color:firebrick;">**Then, write a few sentence interpretations that addresses this statistical
    question and considers the *shape*, *center* and *spread* of the distributions of
    the graphs you create.**</span>
